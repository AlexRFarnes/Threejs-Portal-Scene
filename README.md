## General info

A scene of a portal in the middle of the woods. All the modeling, texturing, uv unwrapping, and baking was made on Blender. The model was optimized for better performances. The model was then exported to Three.js where it was tweaked with custom shaders for the portal and particles.

Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
